# Analysing-Traveller-Details

In the project "Analysing Traveller Details" utilizing Microsoft Excel, I meticulously processed a dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/traveler-trip-data). The dataset included essential columns such as TripID, Destination City, Destination Country, Continent, Start date, End date, Traveler name, Age, Gender, Traveler nationality, Accommodation Type, Accommodation cost, Transportation Type, Transportation mode, Transportation cost, and Total cost.

The project involved an extensive data cleaning and preprocessing phase, where I addressed issues like date and currency formatting. Leveraging advanced Excel formulas, cell referencing, and sum functions, I ensured the data was refined for accurate analysis. Pivot tables and charts were employed to extract meaningful insights, providing a comprehensive view of traveler details.

To enhance user interaction, I incorporated slicers for seamless data filtering. The dashboard's interactivity was further amplified by integrating simple VBA code with buttons, allowing users to navigate effortlessly to external platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and a dedicated query form.

This project showcases my commitment to detail-oriented data processing and analysis, utilizing Excel's advanced functionalities to derive actionable insights. The implementation of VBA code for navigation adds an element of user-friendliness, transforming the dataset into an interactive dashboard that facilitates easy exploration of traveler details.
